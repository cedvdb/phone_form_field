## 4.1.0
- Update phone_number_parser library to 4.0.1, that library has breaking changes which could be reflected in the usage here

## [4.0.0]

- fix reset and usage as a FormField in general
- fix onChanged & onSaved
- fix late initialization error when no country was selected in bottom sheet selector

### UI
- added localized phone formatter

# Validation
- Add PhoneValidator class to easily customize validation and defaults localization error messagees
- Add PhoneFormField `validator` property
- **[BREAKING CHANGE]** Remove `PhoneFormField` properties `errorText` & `phoneNumberType`. Define `validator` property instead with `PhoneValidator.invalid*`

# Misc
- refactored internals
- [Breaking] light parser was removed.
- [Breaking] exposed `autoFillHints` and removed the `withHint` param
- [Breaking] renamed all instances of `dialCode` to `countryCode` as dial code was semantically incorrect.
